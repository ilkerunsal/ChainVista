# Shared Libraries and DTOs

Reusable types, data transfer objects (DTOs) and client SDKs can be placed here. You might include:

- Common C# classes used by both the API and worker services.
- TypeScript types/interfaces shared between the indexer and UI.
- Client helpers for calling the API from the UI.
